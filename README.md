# TTK4900 Masteroppgave

Welcome to the Git repo of the master thesis project of Kristian Blom the spring of 2024, in which a defunct robotic arm from the 1990s was refurbished with new control hardware and software.

The main branch presents the project as it was at the end of the project's implementation, and shall not be altered until final censure has fallen on the project report.


The censure branch presents a curated version of project items deemed relevant to censure. Should the censor(s) find the main branch unnecessarily cluttered, this branch may be of interest.

### Directory: PCBs
Contains KiCad PCB design files.

### Directory: code/ros
Contains all code pertaining to ROS nodes and their configuration.

### Directory: code/stm config official
Contains all code pertaining to arm onboard software modules.

### Directory: documentation external
Contains hardware datasheets, application notes etc. for units used in the project. Most of these are cited as sources in the report.

### Directory: documentation internal
Contains documentation generated for the project.

The file journal.md contains notes taken during development.

A PDF version of the generated code documentation may be found here, in the file "kristian\_blom\_ttk4900\_documentation.pdf".

An HTML version of the generated code documentation may be found here, in the file "kristian\_blom\_ttk4900\_documentation\_html.zip". Its contents may be accessed by downloading and extracting the zip, then accessing "index.html" from a web browser.

Should the configuration of the STM32F303 processor be of interest, beyond what is presented in the thesis, an automatically generated report may be found in "stm\_config\_official.pdf"

Other items in this directory deemed relevant to the censure of the project are presented in the thesis, and may safely be ignored.
